          <div style="display: block;max-width: 600px;margin: 0 auto;color: #fff;background-color: #6a6a6a;border-radius: 20px;padding: 40px;list-style-type: square;">
            <span style="font-size:14px;text-align:center;text-decoration: underline;line-height: 28px;">Launch Your NFT Project</span>
            <span>Mint-on-Demand
              <span>MintedWithLovelace will monitor your address for payments and mint an NFT immediately upon a matching payment</span>
            </span>
            <span>Scale Any Size Project
              <span>Setup your project of 1 or a few NFTs, or thousands</span>
            </span>
            <span>Mint-at-Buyer Option
              <span>Minting can occur at your buyer's wallet or a wallet of your choosing</span>
            </span>
            <span>Smart Whitelisting
              <span>An optional whitelist can be used for any project/profile with an additional option of removing from the whitelist after a successful mint. Whitelisting will whitelist the entire wallet for complex/long addresses!</span>
            </span>
            <span>Sale and Auction Modes
              <span>Run your NFT project using a set price, a range, or an auction-style</span>
            </span>
            <span>Random or Ordered Minting
              <span>Configure your project to mint a random NFT from your collection or mint in either ascending or descending order</span>
            </span>
            <span>Integrated Wallet & Policy Keys *optional
              <span>Not only is MintedWithLovelace a decentralized NFT marketplace app, it is also a wallet dapp (limited in Alpha version). When you setup a new project/profile, you can choose to generate your wallet and policy keys using the dapp. You still own your key files, it just makes it easier!</span>
            </span>
            <span>Automated IPFS Image Processing and Pinning
              <span>With full support for both pinata and blockfrost, preparing your images is as simple as telling the dapp what folder they are in and waiting for them to process and upload to your pinning service provider.</span>
            </span>
            <span>Choose Between IPFS or 100% On-chain SVG & HTML
              <span>Run your NFT project using PNG images, pinned on IPFS, or using SVG images and HTML content for 100% on-chain minting (capability limited based on image size)</span>
            </span>
            <span>Automated JSON File Generation
              <span>NFT json files are autogenerated in the background when you setup your project. No need to structure individual JSON files for each image.</span>
            </span>
            <span>Auto-Refunding w/ Optional Fees
              <span>When you setup your project, depending on the parameters you set, payments received that do not match the criteria will be automatically refunded to the sender. You can also set to deduct a refund fee.</span>
            </span>
            <span>Native Token Fee Replacement for Auctions *optional
              <span>Allow your users the option of sending your native token along with bids for auction style campaigns, wherein they will be refunded their ADA fee if theirs is not a winning bid(s).</span>
            </span>
            <span>100% On-Chain Auction Support
              <span>Using your own native token, you can run an auction which provides "hints" in the form of your native token, sent when a bid does not reach the reserve price.</span>
            </span>
            <span>Manual Minting
              <span>Mint any native token as a "one-off", great for custom minting of a few from a collection, preminting some NFTs, minting non-NFT tokens, etc. Can be minted standalone or assigned to a policy ID you own.</span>
            </span>
            <span>Decentralized SmartContract Registry
              <span>In preparation for the future releases of MintedWithLovelace, every minting project/profile you create in the dapp will be registered in MintedWithLovelace SmartContract Registry. This registry will be used for enforcing royalty payments in the secondary marketplace of the MintedWithLovelace dApp (releasing in 2022).</span>
            </span>
            <span style="font-size:14px;text-align:center;text-decoration: underline;line-height: 28px;">Sell or Swap (secondary market)</span>
            <span>Single Sale (SmartContract or Wallet-to-Wallet)
              <span>Setup a simple NFT or non-NFT Token Swap either using your own smartcontract, a built-in smartcontract which autocompiles when you setup, or just wallet-to-wallet. In all cases the buyer just needs to send your Cardano address the amount required and the swap will occur instantly.</span>
            </span>
            <span>Token Exchange (SmartContract or Wallet-to-Wallet)
              <span>Setup a your own micro-dex, making a Cardano native token available on-demand when N amount of ADA is received. This can be a set amount or an "exchange rate" (e.g. 100 tokens per 1 ADA)</span>
            </span>
            <span style="font-size:14px;text-align:center;text-decoration: underline;line-height: 28px;">Additional Features</span>
